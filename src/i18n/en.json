I like it when everything fits like a well-designed game with invisible mechanics. I blend logic and aesthetics to develop systems from start to finish, uniting structure, functionality, and visual experience.",
    "desc2": "Also, I'm a Leo, curious, expressive, and a bit stubborn (just the right amount). I run on iced coffee, pixel art, and playlists that change with every commit. If I‚Äôm not coding or sketching, I‚Äôm probably mid-game, mid-course, or mid-thought."

A feminine figure falls through an aesthetically harmonious environment, composed of beauty-related objects like cosmetics, packaging, and soft colors. The contrast between the surroundings' gentleness and the figure's body language conveys an ambiguous tension between control and surrender. The composition reflects how beauty ideals can become oppressive structures, disguised as normality."
